# About this tutorial

_Tomita parser_ is a tool for extracting structured data (facts) from natural-language text. Fact extraction is based on context-free grammars and keyword dictionaries.

This tutorial is intended for beginning parser users. It provides an overview of how to make grammars and dictionaries, and how to configure and run the parser. A description of the grammar syntax, a list of tags that are used, and the specifications for generated file formats are provided in the [Developer's guide](../dg/README.md).
